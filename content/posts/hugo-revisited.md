I'm officially restarting my blog as of tonight. Or it might be more accurate to say that I'm officially starting it. My previous attempt was just an experiment. I used the articles as canvases to explore what I could do with Hugo, rather than creating content for people to read. I'm starting fresh this time, with a new and improved theme. It looks the same as the old one, but its a lot nicer under the hood. I was going to write about it in this article, but I'll save it for another time.
