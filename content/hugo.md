This is my first public blog post other than some test posts I made to demo [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.com). Well, to be 100% accurate I used to run a non-public blog with [lb](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb). This was back before I bought a domain and started a website for real.

Hugo is a breeze. I had a little difficulty at first because I was running Hugo through the `hugo server` command. It seems like a bad idea in retrospect. I already have nginx, so why would I want another web server just to do what Nginx already does?

So now I update my site with the `hugo` command and serve my website via nginx. It doesn't auto-detect changes like `hugo server` but maybe there's a workaround?

Anyway, I'm going to continue tinkering with Hugo. If I ever revive my youtube channel this will be where I put any show notes.
